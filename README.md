# CS450 High Level Racket Projects
The Structure of Higher Level Languages:

CS450, "The Structure of Higher Level Languages," is an in-depth course designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of the semantics of both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. This course aims to build foundational knowledge from the ground up, making it accessible even to those without prior experience in functional programming.

Understanding Functional Programming:
  - Gain an in-depth understanding of the principles and practices of functional programming, a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

Exploring Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Delve into the concepts of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Mechanisms for Parameter Passing:
  - Learn various strategies for passing parameters in functions and methods, including pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.

Scoping and Dynamic Storage Allocation:
  - Understand the concepts of scoping, including block and function-level scope, and dynamic memory allocation in programming.

Implementation of Programming Concepts:
  - Apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios, particularly in implementing functional and object-oriented programming constructs.

Racket:
  - A modern dialect of LISP, known for its powerful functional programming features. Racket will be both the medium of instruction and the subject of study, providing a unique perspective on programming language design and implementation.
