;; Exercise 2
; Standard graph algorithm: return all handles reacheable via `contained`.
; Hint: Consider solving this exercise last, as conceptually the most difficult
;       exercise.
; Hint: This is a simple breadth-first algorith. The algorithm should start
;       in env and obtain the set of next elemens by using `contained`.
; Hint: The algorithm must handle cycles.
; Hint: Do not hardcode your solution to frames (you should test it with
;       frames though)

;; Exercise 6 (MANUALLY GRADED)
#|
If we assume that the reference count algorithm is faulty and the reference count overflows resetting back to zero,
it's possible that the correctness and the completeness of memory management, in freeing memory that is no longer used, may be affected.
The memory manager could incorrectly release memory, that's still in use if the reference count resets to zero.
Undefined behavior and improper program execution may often occur from this. Additionally, if the reference count often exceeds,
the memory management can fail to release memory that is no longer needed, which could result in memory leaks and reduce completeness.
In conclusion, an overflowing reference count can undermine the soundness and completeness of the memory management system and endanger its integrity.
